## Introduction  
> A junior Back-end developer based on Spring Framework.  

I love all logical things. Mathematics, algorithms, origami, and others! They have full of wonder and endless expendity.  
Also these days, I like to learn foreign language. So at first I created this blog write on English for study. So some sentences might be weird, please understend this issue and thanks in advance for your patience and read this introduction.  
Anyway, welcome to my playground! Have fun on here!
