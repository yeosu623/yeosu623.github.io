Our teams of project for my software engineering lecture will be doing based on "Waterfall model". Here is the brief schedule below :

1.  Our team will plan the requirements for program. And we need to hand out SRS(Software Requirement Specification) for my instructor.

2.  Then, we need to write diagram clearly with the function of classes, class structure and behavior, UI/UX, database, etc. Of course, we need to hand out SDS(Software Design Specification) too.
3.  Next, we need to implement the program based on the diagram we wrote previous.
4.  And we need to test our program. The test will be conducted with the SRS document.
5.  Finally, we will have the presentation for show our prototype program. The presentation will be doing on 20 minutes.



This project is related on my university software engineering lecture. I will post about the concept of software engineering on dev category of my blog. I will only post about the progress of this project about software engineering on this project category.
