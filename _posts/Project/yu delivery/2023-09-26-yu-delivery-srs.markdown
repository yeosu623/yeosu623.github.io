## What is SRS?
---
SRS, Software Requirements Specification, is a detailed document of what clients want to implement in their software. So the client and the system developer make agreement on what the system should and should not do.

SRS includes this aspects :

- Project name, description
- Requirement description
- Traceability (e.g. the link to move on another screen, the same features with different button)
- Priority

And the SRS should follow these checklists :

- Does the document conform to the given form in the appendix?
- Does the document include the table of contents and page numbers?
- Does the introduction include objectives and goals of the target software system?
- Is the document readable?
- Is the document consistent?
- Is the document unambiguous?
- Is the document complete?
- The diagrams used in the report conform UML specification?



## What our team will do
---
Our team will do the virtual food delivery service project on web site, not on mobile application. Like many other delivery service application, users can order to the restaurant on web site, and once the restaurant is ready for food, the deliver get it and give it for user. Also, we will apply Map API to calculate straight distance between the user and the restaurant to estimate the remaining time for delivery time.

One consider is that our team members cannot make website screen. They all have a skill for database and back-end, so we may use template for show screen at future.

You can see the detailed [SRS document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BNb_r79PrdFtidjPIB04YkUaLFWaepdw_7ow2YPwB04/edit#gid=0) here. But as I am going to the University at Republic of Korea, so this document is written by Korean. Sorry in advance to you who speak English.
