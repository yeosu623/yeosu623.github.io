## What is software process model?
---
In 1988, one of the legendary software developer Boehm says "determines the order of stages involved in SW development and evolution, and to establish the **transition criteria** for progressing one stage to the next. These include completion criteria for the current stage plus choice criteria and entrance for the next stage."

Thus, a process model addresses the following SW project question :

- What shall we do next?
- How long shall we continue to do it?

Therefore, process models have a 2-fold effect :

- They provide **guidance** to software engineers on the order in which the various technical activities should be carried out within a project.
- They afford a framework for **managing development and maintenance**, in that they enable us to estimate resources, define intermediate milestones, monitor progress, etc.

Processes are important because industry cares about their intrinsic qualities, such as <u>uniformity of performance across different projects and productivity</u>, with the aim of improving time to market and reducing production costs.
