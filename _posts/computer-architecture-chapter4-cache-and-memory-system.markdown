## Types of Memory
---
There are two types of memory : volatile, non-volatile.

- Volatile : Random Access Memory (RAM). It's access time is the same for all locations.
  - DRAM : Dynamic Random Access Memory.
    - High Density (1 transistor cell), low power, cheap, slow
    - Dynamic means that it is needed to be "refreshed" regularly (every 4~8 ms).
  - SRAM : Static Random Access Memory.
    - Low density (6 transistor cells), high power, expensive, **fast**
    - Static means that it's content will last forever, until power turned off.
- Non-volatile : Random Flashes (SSD, EEPROM). It's access time varies from location to location and from time to time. (HDD Disk, CD-ROM).
  - Read is faster than erase/write, and finite number of erase cycles.



Let's see these memories one by one.

### Disk Storage

It is non-volatile, rotating magnetic storage.
