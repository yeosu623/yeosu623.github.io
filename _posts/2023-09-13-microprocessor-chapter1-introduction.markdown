## What is microprocessor?

---
A microprocessor is the very small electronic arithmetic operator, other words, it is a very small CPU. It is widely use for most electronic devices, such as smart phone, electronic watch, toys,... and much more!



## The history of microprocessor
---
In 1926, Julius Edgar Lilienfeld get a idea for transistor and patent it, but it cannot be made a real transistor.

In 1948 in Bell lab, the three historical scientists and engineers, Walter Houser Brattain, William Bradford Shockley, John Bardeen made transistor.

In 1971, Intel Corp. introduce the world-first microprocessor, **Intel 4004**. Originally it would be used for electronic calculator, but they were found that it can replace existed simple micro chips. This facts made the trend for microprocessor until these days.

## The difference of microcontroller
---
Some people has confuse a microprocessor and a microcontroller. But they are very different concept.

A microprocessor only has a chip of arithmetic operator, so you must made a circuit for a microprocessor for use it.

A microcontroller contains a microprocessor with I/O pins. so you can simply use it with connect cable to other chips. Arduino is the best well-known microcontroller.

## The brief concept of microprocessor
---
The microprocessor has complex gates and complex circuits. We will see this features one by one on future posts.

And before we dive into microprocessor, I introduce some important terms quickly :

- **Memory** literally stores data. you can connect a various types of memory : ROM, EEPROM, Flash Memory, also you can do it with CD-ROM if you have an appropriate tool!
- **I/O Devices** mean mouse, switches for input, and monitor, LED for output. Plus, USB and Hard Disks can be used for input and output both.
- **Bus** means connections. We will see how to compose for microprocessor later.

- **Instruction** is the binary code of microprocessor command.



Thats all for this post. See you on next chapter!
