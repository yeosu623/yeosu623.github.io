## Definition of Project Management
---
Project Management is creation and maintenance of an internal environment in an enterprise where individuals, working together in groups, can perform efficiently and effectively toward the attainment of group goals.

There are 5 phases of project management : Initiation and Conception, Planning, Launch and Execution, Monitoring and Control, Project Closure.

- Project Initiation and Conception : Recognize business needs, goals, and developing requirements. This is the first activity of software development, the team define exactly what will we made and set the scope.

  After define the problem, feasibility analysis is need for economic viewpoint and technical viewpoint, to determine whether this project can be going to or not.

  One thing need to be considered is legal feasibility. There are Intellectual Property Right and Computer Program Protection Act to block copying software, so need to be careful if the company don't want to be sued.

- Project planning : Consider all about the project in this phase. Set scope for project, estimate the schedule and cost, estimate results, etc. Without planning, much more costs will be used for maintenance.

- Project execution : develop software in a range of planning.

- Project monitoring and control : monitor project during development.

- Project closure : celebrate with team members.

It seems to easy for developing software in a team, but there are many fails occurred by many reasons. Most of the reason is **unambiguous requirement**, **lack of understanding for user environment**, **lack of skills for project management**. Surprisingly, lack of skills for developing doesn't affect much for fail, because there are a lot of information to develop software.



## Cost Estimation for Software
---
Have you thought about how much is your software? How to determine the cost for the software?

Unlike the other product, software is not visual, and its process cannot be standardization. It is difficult in calculate clear development cost. But there are some estimation factors to affect software development costs :

- Programmer Skills
- Software Complexity
- Software Size
- Available Time : Note that the number of humans does not in proportion on developing time. One of the legendary developer, Boehm says "The maximum to decrease time on original planning is up to 75%.". It's not easy to decrease the planning time.
- Reliability Level
- Programming Language : Every developers is not familiar on every programming language. So it is needed to be considered.

So, how can estimate costs for software? There are some types to do that :

- Top-down Approach : Estimated by experts. It will have a high reliability, but it could be inaccuracy because it is set by their experience.
- Bottom-up Approach : Estimated by activity units, estimated line of codes, or the effort per task. But this approach could be very inaccurate, so this isn't used much.
- Mathematical Estimation Techniques :
