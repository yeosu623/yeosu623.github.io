## What is database?
---
Literally, database is large digital data storage. To access database, many corporates use DBMS(Data Base Management System) to manage database with SQL(Structured Query Language) to make interface for normal applications, programs, software.

From past, corporates manage data for individual files, like excel format. But it cannot be guarantee data duplication, which can be serious problem. Plus, they must access data by opening files one by one! So Oracle company made DBMS programs, which is very very expensive, over $400,000...

Here is the question. Why many companies buy this much expensive software? Without DBMS, application developers must consider data structures with complex concepts, like the combination of hashmap, binary tree, list, etc. So with DBMS, many developers can easily make application software.
