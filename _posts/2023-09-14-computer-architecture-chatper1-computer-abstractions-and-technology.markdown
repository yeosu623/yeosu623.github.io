## What we will see in this category
---
We will have a long journey for explore the detailed computer operating mechanism and its architecture. We will see these important points later :

- How high-level programs are translated into the machine language.
- The hardware/software interface
- What determines program performance and how much?
- How hardware designers improve performance
- What is parallel processing



## Levels of Program Code
---
Have you made an question about how my source code runs? So, how programming language like C, C++ or Python codes operates on my computer?

You may heard **Compile** term on your very first programming class. Yes, the compile process convert your **High-level language** into **Assembly language** for MIPS(<u>Microprocessor</u> without interlocked pipeline stage). Then, the **Assembler** converts assembly language to **Machine code(Binary Code)** for MIPS.
